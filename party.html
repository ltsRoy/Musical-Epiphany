It was a warm summer evening and I was getting ready for a Nick's party.<br>
I had been looking forward to it all 
week and I couldn't wait to let loose
and have some fun. <br><br>

As I arrived at the party, 
I was greeted by Nick and Jonas (you bitch lol) who had <br>
decorated the house beautifully 
with balloons and streamers. <br> <br>
The music was already blasting and people
were dancing and laughing. I grabbed a<br>
drink and made my way to the dance floor.
<br>
<br>
The party was filled with a diverse group
of people, some I knew and others I had <br>
just met. We all had a great time together,
dancing, chatting, and playing games. <br>
I was having so much fun that I lost 
track of time. At one point, we even had <br>
a karaoke contest, which was a blast. 
Everyone sang their hearts out and it <br>
was a close competition. Nick won the show.
<br>
<br>
As the night went on, the party began
to wind down. I said goodbye to my friends,<br>
feeling grateful for the memories we had 
just made. It was a night filled with <br>
laughter, music, and good company. 
I met this girl called Claudia.
Maybe I got a crush on her...? <br>
Shit I cant't wait for the next party!

<br>
<br>
Mark.
