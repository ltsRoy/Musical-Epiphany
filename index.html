  Hi. I am Mark.<br>
  <br>
  And if you are reading this, <br>
  I am dead. <br>
  <br>
  This website is being written in a hurry. I have almost no html skills, but this is my last resort to leave a note. I WILL delete this website <br>
  if I manage to escape tonight, and you're never going to find it again.<br>
  <br>
  Here's every possible detail about me:<br>

  Name: Mark Rogers<br>
  Location: El Paso, Texas, US.<br>
  Age: 38<br>
  Phone number: +1 915 889 2679<br>
  Email: markrogerslovescat2002@Ggmail.com<br>
  
  PLEASE take the time and effort to listen to these songs and try to figure out what happened to me. I am afraid I cannot write explicitly. Because if this website<br>
  reaches the wrong people considering I am still alive, my family could be in great danger. I HAVE to communicate through these songs. <br>
  <br>
  Please help me and my family,<br>
  I beg you.<br>
 <br>
  Mark<br>
