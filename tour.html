As the new year has begun, my wife Claudia and I have started planning our tours for 2023 with our daughter Nina. We all love traveling and exploring new places and this year we're excited to make the most of it as a family. <br><br>

First on our list is a trip to Europe. We're planning to visit the beautiful cities of Paris and Rome where we'll be able to admire the famous landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, the Colosseum, and the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Nina is particularly excited to see the Disney Castle in Paris. We're also looking forward to trying the local cuisine and experiencing the different customs and traditions of each country.

Next, we're planning a trip to Asia. We're planning to visit Japan, where we'll be able to see the beautiful temples and gardens, and also the famous cherry blossoms. Nina is also excited to visit the Disneyland in Tokyo. We're also looking forward to visiting the Great Wall of China, and we're planning to take a cruise to see the beautiful Halong Bay in Vietnam.

Lastly, we hope to take a trip to Africa. We're planning to go on safari in Tanzania and visit the Victoria Falls in Zambia. We're also planning to visit the Pyramids in Egypt and the beautiful beaches of Cape Town. Nina is excited to see the elephants and lions in Africa.

Overall, we're excited for the year ahead and the adventures that await us as a family. We can't wait to see the world and make new memories together.
